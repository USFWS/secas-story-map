The LLISS uses the Southeast Conservation Blueprint to help represent regional conservation priorities while using other datasets, like those used to develop the <a href=\"https://research.fs.usda.gov/srs/southern-forest-assessment-library\">Southern Forest Assessment Library</a>, to assess ecosystem condition. By blending these approaches, the framework and tools help the region prioritize based on both an area's importance and the type of action needed (e.g., restoration, protection, management).</p>\n\n<p>In addition, the USFS is using the Southeast Blueprint to help inform funding allocations. To prioritize Southeast firesheds for restoration as part of a short-turnaround request from national leadership, USFS staff overlaid the Blueprint with other regional datasets, including a wildland-urban interface fire risk map.

Spruce-fir is a relic of the last ice age that found refuge atop the highest peaks of the Appalachians, supporting a unique suite of plant and animal species, some of which are found nowhere else in the world. These forests have still not recovered from extensive logging in the late 1800s through early 1900s, which were often followed by catastrophic wildfires.

In addition, planning efforts in Florida and North Carolina involving several different branches of the armed forces have used the Blueprint to map important areas for conservation and military readiness in the face of climate change and urban growth.</p>\n\n<p>The Blueprint has also helped strengthen three successful applications to establish Sentinel Landscapes: the SC Lowcountry, Northwest FL, and Eastern NC. <a href=\"https://sentinellandscapes.org/\">Sentinel Landscapes</a> are defined geographies anchored by at least one military installation or range that contain priority lands for conservation, working lands, and national defense interests across the Depts. of Defense, Agriculture, and Interior. The goal is to facilitate partnerships, make these key landscapes more competitive for federal funding, and connect landowners with programs to keep working lands working (e.g., voluntary tax reduction programs, agricultural loans, technical aid, conservation easements).</p>\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://www.middlegeorgiarc.org/public-administration/rafb-sustainability-plan/\">sustainability plan for Robins Air Force Base</a>, developed in partnership with the Middle Georgia Regional Commission, the Blueprint helped identify priority natural areas in need of conservation within a 10-mile buffer surrounding the base.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates that 14% to 34% of existing salt marshes along the South Atlantic could be lost by 2060 due to sea-level rise alone.</p>\n\n<p>To address these challenges, in 2021 <a href=\"https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2021/07/12/how-southeast-stakeholders-are-safeguarding-salt-marshes\">The Pew Charitable Trusts</a> and leaders from the <a href=\"https://serppas.org/\">Southeast Regional Partnership for Planning and Sustainability</a> launched a regional partnership called the <a href=\"https://marshforward.org/\">South Atlantic Salt Marsh Initiative</a> (SASMI). SASMI brings together partners around the goal of enhancing the long-term abundance, health and resilience of the one million acres of salt marsh in the South Atlantic to ensure no overall loss of the benefits these wetlands provide to fish, wildlife and people. Working closely with SECAS staff, SASMI used the Southeast Conservation Blueprint during initial stakeholder workshops to help visualize priority places for salt marsh conservation action. SECAS staff also contributed to the <a href=\"https://marshforward.org/sasmi-plan/\">SASMI conservation plan</a> by drawing on the best available science and consistent regional data to identify coastal wetlands that are more resilient to threats like sea-level rise, erosion, and coastal development, as well as places where coastal wetlands could migrate in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Through SASMI, the conservation community is rallying around salt marsh and working together to make a greater impact than any one partner could accomplish alone. Using the Southeast Blueprint helps partners find the best places to collaborate to achieve the SASMI goal to maintain and enhance the quality and extent of salt marshes, even in the face of future change.

An early version of the Southeast Conservation Blueprint highlighted two focal watersheds in Puerto Rico: the Rio Grande de Arecibo and Rio Herrera to Cabezas de San Juan. The Rio Grande de Arecibo was selected as the primary focal watershed due to the importance of its groundwater and surface water reservoir resources and its potential for improving connectivity between lands and waters. In addition, the need for a shared, cross-organization plan in that region positioned a collaborative effort like SECAS to fill an important gap.</p>\n\n<p>Partner organizations identified enhancing aquatic connectivity as a key conservation action within the watershed, and SECAS has helped make progress by facilitating the identification of problematic dams and culverts. In March 2019, these partner organizations and others collaborated to remove the high-priority Cambalache Dam. Removal of this low-rise dam connected and restored 15 miles of riverine habitat, allowing migratory fish to travel farther upstream. It also eliminated a safety hazard, decreased erosion, and boosted upstream recreational opportunities.

Longleaf pine forests, with towering trees and open, grassy understories, once spanned 90 million acres from Virginia to Texas. Fire suppression, deforestation, and land-use changes reduced it to only 3% of its former range by the late 1990s. Thanks in part to <a href=\"https://longleafalliance.org/\">The Longleaf Alliance</a> and <a href=\"http://americaslongleaf.org/\">America's Longleaf Restoration Initiative</a>, the longleaf pine forest is now on its way back to prominence.</p>\n\n<p>Seventeen LITs are currently working throughout nine states to manage existing longleaf forests and implement restoration projects. The teams are made up of government agencies, conservation organizations, industry, and private landowners, all sharing resources, ideas and best practices. LITs are drafting conservation plans, identifying collective goals and developing landscape-scale maps to help assess, visualize and track collective longleaf restoration priorities. America's Longleaf and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation are encouraging LITs to share these priorities in a \"Longleaf Restoration Road Map\" to improve range-wide communication and planning.</p> \n\n<p>The Longleaf Alliance has been working closely with LITs and the larger conservation community to collect relevant spatial data, facilitate discussions, and develop priority maps. The Southeast Blueprint proved instrumental in identifying potential high-quality habitat areas for open pine systems outside of partner lands. It also supported data compatibility across the range. In particular, three LITs have applied the Blueprint as a key element in their mapping process:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Chattahoochee Fall Line Conservation Partnership (GA and AL)</li>\n<li>SoLo-ACE Longleaf Partnership (SC)</li>\n<li>DeSoto/Camp-Shelby Local Implementation Team (MS and AL)</li></ul>\n\n<p>These projects used the Blueprint to help map strategic restoration targets to achieve tangible conservation outcomes and support range-wide conservation planning efforts for longleaf.

SECAS staff worked with partners to find the best available data to represent key resources in the Gulf marine environment. As part of our commitment to avoid duplicating the good work of others, SECAS builds on existing datasets wherever possible, often using them in innovative ways to help the conservation community make the best of the resources we already have.</p>\n\n<p>To start, staff pulled together sea turtle and marine mammal models from the Gulf of Mexico Marine Assessment Program for Protected Species (GoMMAPPS), marine highly migratory fish models from the European Commission Joint Research Centre, and deep-sea coral models from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). One obvious gap was hardbottom habitat.</p>\n\n<p>To better represent Gulf hardbottom in the Southeast Blueprint, SECAS staff combined a suite of different data sources into a new indicator, including sediments from usSEABED; artificial reef, shipwreck, and deep-sea coral locations from NOAA; hardbottom and associated species data from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management; and others. Recognizing that this first attempt at a Gulf hardbottom indicator had plenty of room for improvement, staff refined their approach in 2024 and convened a team of 15 experts to review the data and methods. As a result, the 2024 indicator uses better artificial reef and shipwreck data, incorporates new coral and hardbottom locations from the state of Florida and The Nature Conservancy, improves consistency with the Atlantic hardbottom indicator, and more.</p>\n\n<p>In future updates, SECAS staff hope to incorporate GoMMAPPS seabird models into the Blueprint as they become publicly available. The Blueprint will continue to improve its coverage of the Gulf marine environment and the rest of the SECAS geography through its annual revision cycle, incorporating the latest data and feedback from new partners.</p>","photo":"FlowerGardenBanksNMS_NOAA.jpg","caption":"Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary off the coast of TX. <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/noaaphotolib/40023571631/\">Photo</a>: G.

They also provide valuable habitat for birds, fish and shellfish, sea turtles, and more. In the absence of human development, the coastline constantly shifts in response to waves and weather, allowing it to sustain the ecosystem services we rely on. Urban growth and shoreline armoring try to hold this dynamic system in place, causing habitat loss and making our coasts more vulnerable to erosion and sea-level rise.</p>\n\n<p>To encourage the conservation of key coastlines and barrier islands, the Coastal Barrier Resources Act withdraws the availability of most new federal funding and financial assistance, such as flood insurance, within areas designated as part of the <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/program/coastal-barrier-resources-act\">Coastal Barrier Resources System</a> (CBRS). The CBRS contains about 3.5 million acres of wetlands and barrier islands that were mostly natural and undeveloped at the time of designation. The law adopts the sensible approach that the risk associated with development in these areas should be borne by private sector and not underwritten by the American taxpayer.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/story/studies-examine-cbras-effectiveness-saving-money-and-reducing-development\">This system has proved effective</a> in discouraging development in storm- and flood-prone locations; development rates (including shoreline armoring) within the CBRS are more than 75% lower than areas outside it. Additionally, the CBRS is effective in reducing federal disaster spending. One study found that the Act saved $9.5 billion between 1989 and 2013, and projects it may save as much as $108 billion by 2068!</p>\n\n<p>FWS staff are using the Southeast Conservation Blueprint to help assess and communicate the benefits of the Act in the Southeast. The Blueprint prioritizes about 90% of the areas within the Southeast CBRS. Given that the Blueprint prioritizes 50% of the Southeast landscape overall, this highlights the regional conservation importance of the CBRS. The Blueprint is demonstrating how the CBRS helps prevent the loss of habitat that is important for resilience and connectivity.</p>","photo":"BigPineKeyFloridaKeys_ThomasFlickr.jpg","caption":"Sunrise at Big Pine Key in the Florida Keys. <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/photommo/26654339601/in/album-72157666270573071/\">Photo</a>: Thomas/Flickr, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\">CC BY-SA 2.0</a>.","location":"point - in proposed CBRS additions on Big Pine Key; polygon - coastline buffer provided by Paul with CBRS","updated":"2024-08-13"}}]}
