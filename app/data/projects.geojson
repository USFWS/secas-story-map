So far, the Blueprint has informed 10 successful applications from the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (DNR), South Carolina DNR, and North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission.</p>\n\n<p>The Blueprint helped strengthen these proposals in the following ways:\n<ul><li>The Blueprint priorities reinforced the conservation value of the parcels</li>\n<li>The ecosystem indicators helped tell a compelling story about the natural and cultural resources that make each site unique</li>\n<li>Threat projections demonstrated the urgency of conservation action and connected the proposed acquisitions to a larger adaptation strategy</li>\n<li>Broad involvement in the Blueprint from hundreds of individuals and organizations showed how the proposal fit into a shared plan and partner conservation efforts</li></ul></p>\n\n<p>The $9.35 million awarded through these coastal wetlands grants has, in combination with partner match, secured about 13,700 acres of land and supported coastal habitat restoration on over 3,500 acres. Some of the parcels acquired include:\n<ul><li>The 800-acre Altamaha Connector in Georgia, which protects critical nursery habitat for estuarine-dependent fish and crustaceans in the delta of the undammed lower Altamaha River</li>\n<li>A 400-acre site on South Fenwick Island in South Carolina, which contains not only exceptional natural resources, but also many historical features and places important in Gullah-Geechee culture</li>\n<li>A 3,000-acre riverfront parcel along the Waccamaw River in North Carolina, which will add over 1,000 acres of gamelands open to the public for hunting and fishing, and provide a new canoe/kayak landing for public access to the Waccamaw River Blue Trail</li></ul></p>\n",

        "description": "<p>Another key product of SECAS, in addition to the Southeast Blueprint, is the Gulf Coast Vulnerability Assessment. This comprehensive report evaluates the effects of climate change, sea level rise, and urbanization on four Gulf Coast ecosystems and 11 species that depend on them. The ecosystems covered in the assessment include mangrove, oyster reef, tidal emergent marsh and barrier islands. The species are roseate spoonbill, blue crab, clapper rail, mottled duck, spotted seatrout, eastern oyster, American oystercatcher, red drum, black skimmer, Kemp’s ridley sea turtle, and Wilson’s plover.</p> \n\n<p>Of the species assessed, Kemp’s ridley sea turtle is thought to be the most vulnerable species as a result of nesting habitat loss to sea level rise, erosion, and urbanization. Tidal emergent marsh is considered to be the most vulnerable ecosystem due in part to sea level rise and erosion. In general, avian species were more vulnerable than fish because of the exposure and sensitivity of their nesting habitat loss to sea level rise, erosion, and potential increases in storm surge. </p>\n\n<p>Given the potential vulnerabilities of these species and habitats, additional research focus has been placed on them to reduce uncertainties associated with their responses to threats of sea level rise, urbanization, and other land use change. Further, the apparent resilience of some species and habitats to these same stressors has provided greater confidence to managers implementing restoration projects targeting these species and habitats. Additional work is ongoing to further refine the GCVA to improve and expand its utility in decision-making.</p>\n",

        "description": "As a plan for shared conservation action, the Blueprint is helping organizations across different sectors of South Carolina align their efforts and make a bigger collective impact to sustain natural and cultural resources.</p>\n\n<p>The South Carolina chapter of The Nature Conservancy (TNC) used the Blueprint as the foundation for an update to their Conservation Vision. This priority map will guide TNC’s conservation efforts and inform the work of partners, like local land trusts, statewide. They filtered down the Blueprint to identify the hubs, corridors, and buffers and restoration areas that align with their mission. TNC has already used that updated vision to support the successful reauthorization of the SC Conservation Bank. In particular, the Blueprint helped communicate to the state legislature that the conservation community has come together around a shared set of priorities and implemented projects strategically. It also illustrated how using a data-driven conservation plan can ensure funding is targeted in a rigorous way. The Bank is now planning to incorporate the Blueprint in its own prioritization.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is exploring using the Blueprint as the basis for their next State Wildlife Action Plan (SWAP) focus areas map. SC DNR values the Blueprint for several reasons:</p>\n<ul><li>It is an existing dataset that combines many different data layers into one priority map</li>\n<li>It has been thoroughly vetted by a diverse group of conservation professionals for inclusiveness and accuracy</li>\n<li>It allows the agency to identify focus areas that span state lines, better coordinating across boundaries</li>\n<li>It is already in the public domain</li>\n<li>It doesn’t display the parcels of individual private landowners</li>\n<li>It is generated through a transparent and replicable geospatial modelling process</li></ul></p>\n\n<p>Because the SC Forestry Commission also draws on the SWAP focus areas to craft South Carolina's Forest Resource Assessment and Resource Strategy (or the SC Forest Action Plan), the Blueprint may ultimately integrate with other agency priorities.</p>\n",

All other funding from this national program, the Department of Interior’s Wildland Fire Resilient Landscapes, went to the Western United States. SECAS played in important role in bringing some of that funding east of the Mississippi River. The project supported prescribed burning in priority longleaf pine focus areas across the South Atlantic and helped break prescribed fire records in the region! Staff, training, and aerial support were anchored around key longleaf refuges and parks, maintaining and restoring fire not just on federal lands, but on nearby state, private, and non-profit lands as well.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>This project has benefited the fire-dependent longleaf pine ecosystem, including many at-risk species like the red-cockaded woodpecker.

The funding will support prescribed burning, salamander surveys, feral hog control, and water quality monitoring. The decline of the salamander is a local symptom of the broader decline in longleaf pine communities across the Southeast. The area around St. Marks is a high priority in the Blueprint and scores highly in the South Atlantic pine and prairie amphibians indicator.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, Wildland Fire Resilient Landscapes funding supported by the Blueprint went toward growing season burns at St. Marks. Growing season burns are critical for maintaining frosted flatwoods salamander habitat because the species relies on ephemeral wetlands that can be overtaken by woody vegetation in the absence of fire, and breeding occurs in the dormant season. Short-term monitoring suggested refuge salamander populations responded positively to those burns.</p>\n",

The Southeast Blueprint highlights two focal watersheds in Puerto Rico: the Rio Grande de Arecibo and Rio Herrera to Cabezas de San Juan. The Rio Grande de Arecibo was selected as the primary focal watershed due to the importance of its groundwater and surface water reservoir resources and its potential for improving connectivity between lands and waters. In addition, the need for a shared, cross-organization plan in that region positioned a collaborative effort like SECAS to fill an important gap.</p>\n\n<p>Partner organizations identified enhancing aquatic connectivity as a key conservation action within the watershed, and SECAS has helped make progress by facilitating the identification of problematic dams and culverts. In March 2019, these partner organizations and others collaborated to remove the high-priority Cambalache Dam. Removal of this low-rise dam connected and restored 15 miles of riverine habitat, allowing migratory fish to travel farther upstream. It also eliminated a safety hazard, decreased erosion, and boosted upstream recreational opportunities.

        "description": "<p>The Blueprint is contributing to the restoration of longleaf pine across its historic range by helping Longleaf Implementation Teams (LITs) prioritize their conservation and management efforts. Longleaf pine forests, with towering trees and open, grassy understories, once spanned 90 million acres from Virginia to Texas. Fire suppression, deforestation, and land-use changes reduced it to only 3% of its former range by the late 1990s. Thanks in part to <a href=\"https://longleafalliance.org/\">The Longleaf Alliance</a> and <a href=\"http://americaslongleaf.org/\">America’s Longleaf Restoration Initiative</a>, the longleaf pine forest is now on its way back to prominence. Seventeen LITs are currently working throughout nine states to manage existing longleaf forests and implement restoration projects. The teams are made up of government agencies, conservation organizations, industry, and private landowners, all sharing resources, ideas and best practices. LITs are drafting conservation plans, identifying collective goals and developing landscape-scale maps to help assess, visualize and track collective longleaf restoration priorities. America’s Longleaf and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation are encouraging LITs to share these priorities in a <a href=\"https://storymap.longleafalliance.org/roadmap-to-restore-longleaf-pine/\">“Longleaf Restoration Road Map”</a> to improve range-wide communication and planning.</p> \n\n<p>The Longleaf Alliance has been working closely with LITs and the larger conservation community to collect relevant spatial data, facilitate discussions, and develop priority maps. The Blueprint proved instrumental in identifying potential high-quality habitat areas for open pine systems outside of partner lands. It also supported data compatibility across the range. In particular, three LITs have applied the Blueprint as a key element in their mapping process so far:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Chattahoochee Fall Line Conservation Partnership (GA and AL)</li>\n<li>SoLo-ACE Longleaf Partnership (SC)</li>\n<li>DeSoto/Camp-Shelby Local Implementation Team (MS and AL)</li></ul>\n\n<p>These projects used the Blueprint to help map strategic restoration targets to achieve tangible conservation outcomes and support range-wide conservation planning efforts for longleaf. The Blueprint will continue to inform targeted longleaf restoration and management as more LITs identify priority areas in the coming years.

        "description": "<p>Sea-level rise threatens a variety of ecosystems along the Gulf of Mexico, but tidal saline wetlands like mangrove forests, salt marshes, and salt flats are among the most vulnerable. Given sufficient time and space, these wetlands can migrate inland in response to sea-level rise. In support of SECAS, and to better integrate coastal adaptation efforts across the Gulf, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) developed a dataset predicting where inland migration of tidal saline wetlands is expected to occur under different sea-level rise and urbanization scenarios. It identifies where migration is possible due to the absence of barriers, as well as where it’s not due to urban growth and levees. The data is intended to inform the conservation of coastal landscapes as well as help sustain the ecosystem goods and services they provide, such as buffering storm impacts and providing nursery habitat for commercial fisheries. You can <a href=\"http://gcpolcc.databasin.org/galleries/bbfff0152bb14aa5aea5012d02f3156f\">view the data online in the Tidal Saline Wetland Gallery on the Gulf Coast Plains and Ozarks CPA</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/55f742a8e4b0477df11c0a2b\">download the data from ScienceBase</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Nature Conservancy’s (TNC) Gulf of Mexico Program partnered with USGS to help communities across the Gulf coast use the wetland migration data and other complementary coastal adaptation resources. This effort, also supported in part by staff and funding from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Science Applications program, furthered TNC’s work to increase the use of natural infrastructure in the Gulf region. TNC and USGS hosted a series of workshops in the summer of 2017 to help local governments, land trusts and resource managers identify opportunities to protect open space and wetland migration corridors through land acquisition, land use planning, and the National Flood Insurance Program’s Community Rating System. Representatives from 41 cities and 26 counties and parishes attended to better understand how to use the wetland migration projections and sea-level rise information in their decision-making. After the workshops, TNC and USGS provided custom data products to 68 attendees who requested additional data and maps.</p> \n\n<p>In Charlotte Harbor, the workshop led to discussions about a mangrove restoration project, in    the form of a living shoreline, along a seawall in front of a Sheraton Hotel. The hotel is a partner in the planning process and helped fund a mangrove shoreline design in partnership with the City of Punta Gorda, TNC, and the Charlotte Harbor National Estuary Program. The partners continue to pursue funding for implementation of this project.</p>\n",
